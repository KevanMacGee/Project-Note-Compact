# Project Note Compact

This is a very basic tool to replace Note pad notes on projects. When I work on small side projects, I always end up with a txt file full of To-Dos and links to things I want to refer to about the project. This is a replacement for those.

It's important to note that this is a basic "Duct tape level" tool, not a replacement for something like Notion or Evernote.
