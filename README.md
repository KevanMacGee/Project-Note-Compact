# Project Notes - Compact

This is a very basic tool to replace Notepad notes on projects. When I work on small side projects, I always end up with a .txt file full of To-Dos and reference URLs of resources related to the project I'm working on. This is a replacement for that.

It's important to note that this is a very basic, "duct tape level" engineering tool, not a replacement for something like Notion or Evernote.

### What this project is:

* It's a hacky little rudimentary tool to organize ToDos and relevant links when working on a project.

### What it is not:

* Perfect. 

* Made with users in mind that are not me.
